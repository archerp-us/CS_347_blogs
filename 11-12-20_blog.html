        As the second project is beginning to take shape, I decided to do some research 
        this week related to my topic in hopes of finding some features to add to my web app. 
        I hope to create a sort of interactive app for users that works with an election 
        database for the state of Virginia. I want users to be able to find information 
        on local and state candidates and elections for their district and was hoping to 
        incorporate this into an interactive map. Last semester I worked with a group to 
        build a web-based platform for a database of colleges in Virginia and was able to 
        create an interactive map just using google maps, but this time I am looking to do 
        this in JavaScript and html.

        After looking into this topic, I was able to find a nice tutorial about how this 
        might be accomplished using the tools we are allowed for this project. This map can be 
        created mostly using JavaScript we have learned the past couple along with a couple 
        operations to get information from the database. Mainly this process includes adding 
        JavaScript to query the database when a user selects a portion of the map. Going off a 
        couple sources I found, this seems manageable and I hope to incorporate this function 
        into my project.
