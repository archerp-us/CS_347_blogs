        If I were to teach CS 347 next fall, I would design my class similarly to the 
        way this yearâ€™s class was designed with a few changes. To start, I think that 
        the material in this class has been very helpful to my understanding of the subject 
        and would probably align my lectures very similarly in terms of material taught each 
        week of the semester. Starting with HTML and CSS really helped create a 
        general understanding of web page design and layout that gives a good basis for the 
        later material in the course. In the second half of the course, switching focus to 
        JavaScript with Node and REACT has worked out well, but I think I would add a few more 
        lectures on this material as there is a lot to cover and it relates very well to what 
        many students will likely be doing in their future jobs. With the material organized 
        this way I would create projects, tests, and assignments to enhance understanding of 
        each topic.

        I would probably change up the way the lectures are presented and move back to a more 
        standard version with in-class lectures each week. The videos are a nice touch, but I 
        feel that the interaction of presenting the material live has some benefits as well. 
        Also, adding some videos on particularly difficult material would be helpful so that 
        students can go back on their own time and review the material as needed. In each class 
        I would set aside some time to work on a lab as well, like we did for this class since 
        working with the material in this hands on way really increases understanding of the 
        subject and helps with projects. I like the project and test set up in this class and 
        would probably keep that pretty much the same, with two bigger projects instead of several 
        smaller projects throughout the semester. The bigger projects give students the opportunity 
        to create something they can reference and use as a portfolio piece and allows them to 
        create something they are more passionate about. A few tests are good to include to 
        make sure everyone is up to speed on the material, but the projects and weekly activities 
        provide a better way to check students progress more often. Overall, I have learned a great 
        deal in this class and know that it will translate well into my future work and so for my 
        class the design would be similar as I would want students to feel the same way after 
        completing the course.
