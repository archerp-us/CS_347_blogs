<h1>Blog for September 17, 2020</h1>

<p>This week I did some research about embedding social media feeds into a website. 
    I hope to do this with my website for project one as my client will need a place to 
    post media from sites like YouTube and Facebook. Rather than just adding a few posts 
    onto the website I want to be able to embed the entire channel or feed so that it will 
    get updated with any new posts on the social media sites. Facebook makes this pretty easy 
    with the use of their page plugin tool, which is used to embed a public page into a website 
    with the option to view and react to posts the same you would on the Facebook website.
</p>

<p>
    Facebook has the html and JavaScript code necessary for embedding on their website along 
    with several attributes that can be edited to match the layout of the website. Using the 
    page plugin requires making a div for the Facebook page that contains the attributes to edit. 
    Possible attributes include options to edit the width, height and decide which parts of the 
    Facebook page show up on the new website. This should be very useful in my project as I can 
    just create the div on my social media page to embed the page and tune each attribute to fit 
    the overall website style.

<h4>Example Code for Embedding a Facebook Page:</h4>

<pre>
    &lt;div id="fb-root">&lt;/div>
    &lt;script async defer crossorigin="anonymous" src="https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v8.0" 
    nonce="JumsYAOD">&lt;/script>

    &lt;div&gt; class="fb-page" data-href="https://www.facebook.com/facebook" data-tabs="timeline" 
    data-width="" data-height="" data-small-header="false" data-adapt-container-width="true" 
    data-hide-cover="false" data-show-facepile="true">&lt;blockquote cite="https://www.facebook.com/facebook" 
    class="fb-xfbml-parse-ignore">&lt;a&gt; href="https://www.facebook.com/facebook">Facebook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
