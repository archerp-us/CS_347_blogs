        Designing webpages with HTML/CSS allows the creator to fine tune any aspect 
        of the site with seemingly limitless design options. While many websites are designed 
        with the user in mind, not everyone will be pleased with the site or appreciate the design. 
        Allowing the webpage visitor to have some control over minor aspects of page design can 
        ensure that everyone will enjoy a website, since it is tailored specifically for their 
        own experience. Giving the option to change the background color of text on the page or 
        the page itself allows the user to feel they have some control over their experience and 
        increases positivity towards the site.

        Many programmers are not thrilled with the idea of giving any sort of control 
        over to a user, as it tends to cause many new problems to arise. Using select and option 
        tags in HTML are a fun, safe way of giving users the ability to edit a portion of the page 
        without compromising the developers hard work. Drop down menus can be created in HTML with 
        color options that a user may click to decide the perfect background color that will 
        complement their viewing experience. This interesting aspect of HTML is a great way to make 
        the user feel important and gives them a small look into the world of webpage design.
