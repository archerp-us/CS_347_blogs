        Going off the suggestion to study redux this week, I decided to do just that. 
        While preparing for the final project, I thought that it would be a good idea 
        to look into the subject more as well. I other classes I have done some work with 
        JavaScript and databases, but never used react apps or redux before. Through the 
        video lectures from this week I now see how these other libraries work with JavaScript 
        and can expand the functionality in the backend of a website.

        Looking into redux examples I found a program to search a database and returns 
        results that can also be selected and leads to more similar results. This type of 
        design I think could work well in my web app project. I am hoping to add a search bar 
        to query a database in my own app that will produce results in a similar manner to the 
        example I found. Researching this topic this week has given me a better understanding 
        of redux and how it works as well as some ideas for how to take advantage of what this 
        library offers in my project.
